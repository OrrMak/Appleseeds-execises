        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 tablespoons (90 mL) aquafaba</li>
            <li>3 medium-sized very ripe bananas, (plus 1 optional ripe banana for decoration)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons (90 mL) oat milk, or plain-flavored plant-based milk of choice</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>1/3 cup (75g) sunflower oil, olive oil, or any neutral-tasting oil</li>
            <li>3/4 cup (115g) organic brown sugar or coconut sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon sea salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Method</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F/176°C. Arrange a rack in the bottom third of the oven. Line a 9×5-inch (23×13 cm) loaf pan with parchment paper, letting the excess hang over the long sides to form a sling.</li>
    <li>Pour the aquafaba into a medium bowl. Using a handheld electric mixer, whip the aquafaba on medium speed for 45-60 seconds until uniformly foamy.</li>
    <li>Wipe out the bowl used for the aquafaba. Add the three bananas to the bowl and mash with a fork until smooth and no lumps remain (or, for a more rustic banana bread, leave a few chunks in). FYI: the 3 mashed bananas should weigh around 300g.</li>
    <li>Stir the lemon juice into the oat milk and set aside. This is the vegan "buttermilk."</li>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, add the sugar and oil. Mix using the electric mixer or a whisk until well combined.</li>
    <li>Add the whipped aquafaba and mix until well incorporated. Add in the vegan "buttermilk" and vanilla and mix until smooth. Add the mashed bananas and mix until well incorporated.</li>
    <li>Add the flour, salt, baking soda, and cinnamon to the wet ingredients. Switch to using a silicone spatula (if you don’t have one, use a large wooden spoon). Gently stir until the ingredients are just barely combined. It’s okay if you can see a few traces of flour.</li>
    <li>Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth out the top of the batter using a spatula or spoon.</li>
    <li>For the optional decoration, keep the peel on the reserved banana and slice it in half, lengthwise; then peel the banana. Sprinkle a little coconut sugar or brown sugar on the cut/interior sides of the banana. Gently arrange the bananas on top the batter, sugared side side up.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 45 to 55 minutes. Since every home oven differs, I like to start checking at 45 minutes.The banana bread is done when a toothpick inserted into the center top at a slight angle comes out a few moist crumbs (see Note 6). If there's runny batter, it needs more time.</li>
